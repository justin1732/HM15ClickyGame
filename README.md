# Clicky Game in React JS

## Matching up Star Ocean Characters

This was the second-to-last individual project for the University of Denver FullStack Coding Bootcamp.

This app uses React JS and Heroku Deployment to create "in state objects" that are randomly assigned value and look like cards. The user then clicks on the cards to generate points and try to "win" by selecting all the individual cards. If the user fails in that task, the score gets reset to zero and the user getsto try again. This project again used Star Ocean characters and themes to generate a rather unique look and feel.

## Starting the app locally

For a local version, I recommend using Visual Studio Code. Navigate over to my GitHub repo, click clone, and be sure to type in the following below:
git clone

Then type:

npm install

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

For remote viewing, my app is on Heroku at:

Finally, my repo can be found at:

## Using this application

Click on different characters to try and click on all of them without repeating (different pictures are fine). If you don't, you'll have to repeat the process all over again. You can see your high score in the window above.

## Technologies Used

This application follows MERN deployment principles with MVP file and folder structuring. This application relies upon React JS connected through Heroku for deployment. This app relies heavily on JSON and JSON rendering to render the objects and communicate with the local database. Other dependencies include React Bootstrap for assistance in rendering and organization..
